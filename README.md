# Magic-Tuning-Fork
This repository contains projects 2-5 from my CS 4253: Artificial Intelligence
class. Project 1 was wiped from my hard drive (should have been using Github
from the beginning, huh?). It was merely and introduction to Lisp, however.
Also, note that not all of this code was written by me; some of it was written
by my class professor.
